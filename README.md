# 🌬️ Product-Market Fit Analysis — **AirPure Innovations**

## 📋 Project Overview

This project presents a **comprehensive product-market fit analysis** for **AirPure Innovations**, a startup planning to enter India's rapidly growing **air purifier market**. Using **3+ years of AQI data** across Indian cities, health impact patterns, and demand triggers, this analysis identifies:

- ✅ **Priority launch markets** (Tier 1/2 cities)  
- ✅ **Must-have product features** based on dominant pollutants  
- ✅ **Market sizing & demand patterns**  
- ✅ **Region-specific R&D recommendations**

## 🎯 **Business Context & Challenge**

**AirPure Innovations** is a new startup aiming to address the rising **air pollution crisis in India**. The company is in the early stages of product development and is unsure whether there is a **strong, sustained demand** for its air purifier product.

### 🧩 **Critical Business Questions**

- What pollutants should the air purifier target?  
- What **features** are essential for product development?  
- Which cities have the **highest demand potential?** 
- How can R&D align with localized **pollution patterns?**

### ⚠️ **The Stakes**

Before committing to manufacturing and R&D investment, the company needed **data-driven validation** that there is a **clear market need**, with strong and sustained demand across specific Indian cities.

## 🧠 **Methodology & Framework**

I developed a **4-step validation framework** to assess product–market fit:

### **🔹 Step 1: Does the Problem Actually Exist? (AQI Severity Analysis)**  
- Examined **AQI trends** and severity mapping across regions  
- Identified **pollution hotspots** and **seasonal patterns**  

### **🔹 Step 2: Do Enough People Face This Problem? (Consumer Awareness)**  
- Validated **population exposure** in high-AQI zones  
- Assessed consumer awareness using **search trends**  
- Evaluated **government actions** and **policy impacts**  


### **🔹 Step 3: Does This Problem Significantly Impact Lives? (Health Impact)**  
- Correlated **health outcomes** with AQI data  
- Analyzed **disease outbreaks**, hospital admissions, and mortality trends  
- Identified **age groups most affected**  

### **🔹 Step 4: Can the Target Market Afford the Solution? (Economic Feasibility)**  
- Assessed buying capacity using **MPCE (Monthly Per Capita Expenditure)**  
- Layered **economic data** onto pollution hotspots  
- Calculated **economic feasibility scores** by region  


## 🔍 **Analysis Dimensions**

> - 📍 **AQI Severity** → Where is pollution worst?  
> - 🏥 **Health Impact** → Who is most affected?  
> - 🧠 **Consumer Awareness** → Do people know about the problem?  
> - 💰 **Economic Feasibility** → Can they afford solutions?
