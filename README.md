## 🎯 **Business Context & Challenge**

**AirPure Innovations** is a new startup aiming to address the rising **air pollution crisis in India**. The company is in the early stages of product development and is unsure whether there is a **strong, sustained demand** for its air purifier product.

### 🧩 **Critical Business Questions**

- What pollutants should the air purifier target?  
- What **features** are essential for product development?  
- Which cities have the **highest demand potential?** 
- How can R&D align with localized **pollution patterns?**

### ⚠️ **The Stakes**

Before committing to manufacturing and R&D investment, the company needed **data-driven validation** that there is a **clear market need**, with strong and sustained demand across specific Indian cities.

## 🧠 **Methodology & Framework**

I developed a **4-step validation framework** to assess product–market fit:

### **🔹 Step 1: Does the Problem Actually Exist? (AQI Severity Analysis)**  
- Examined **AQI trends** and severity mapping across regions  
- Identified **pollution hotspots** and **seasonal patterns**  

### **🔹 Step 2: Do Enough People Face This Problem? (Consumer Awareness)**  
- Validated **population exposure** in high-AQI zones  
- Assessed consumer awareness using **search trends**  
- Evaluated **government actions** and **policy impacts**  


### **🔹 Step 3: Does This Problem Significantly Impact Lives? (Health Impact)**  
- Correlated **health outcomes** with AQI data  
- Analyzed **disease outbreaks**, hospital admissions, and mortality trends  
- Identified **age groups most affected**  

### **🔹 Step 4: Can the Target Market Afford the Solution? (Economic Feasibility)**  
- Assessed buying capacity using **MPCE (Monthly Per Capita Expenditure)**  
- Layered **economic data** onto pollution hotspots  
- Calculated **economic feasibility scores** by region  


## 🔍 **Analysis Dimensions**

>  📍 [**AQI Severity**](https://github.com/Sahu-Ashwani/Product-Market-Fit-Analysis/blob/main/AQI%20Severity%20Dashboard.png) → Where is pollution worst?  
>  🏥 [**Health Impact**](https://github.com/Sahu-Ashwani/Product-Market-Fit-Analysis/blob/main/Health%20Impact%20Dashboard.png) → Who is most affected?  
>  🧠 [**Consumer Awareness**](https://github.com/Sahu-Ashwani/Product-Market-Fit-Analysis/blob/main/Consumer%20Awareness%20Dashboard.png) → Do people know about the problem?  
>  💰 [**Economic Feasibility**](https://github.com/Sahu-Ashwani/Product-Market-Fit-Analysis/blob/main/Economic%20Feasibility%20Dashboard.png) → Can they afford solutions?

## 🔍 **Key Insights & Findings**

- **Delhi NCR residents breathe toxic air for 186+ days annually (50.8% of the year)** — creating **desperate, sustained demand** that positions this market as a **health emergency**, not just a business opportunity.

- **6 emergency markets identified** with urgent demand *right now*:  
  **Greater Noida (186 poor-air days), Delhi (175), Gurugram (169), NOIDA (155), Patna, and Muzaffarnagar**, all show severe AQI levels **and** high frequency of poor-air days.

- **November to February** consistently shows the **worst air quality across 3 years (2022–2025)**, creating a predictable **4-month peak selling season** with maximum urgency.

- **PM2.5 and PM10 contribute 87% of pollution in target markets** (vs 79% nationally), product **must prioritize high-efficiency filtration** for these two particles as the **core value proposition**.

- **Delhi NCR** combines the **worst pollution** with the **highest MPCE scores** — meaning the target market has both **problem severity** and **economic capacity** to afford premium air purifiers.

- **Google Trends shows a 340% spike** in *“air purifier”* searches during **Nov–Jan pollution peaks** — indicating strong **awareness → intent → purchase** conversion during these crisis periods.
